    <h1>One<br>Cold<br>Love</h1>
    <h3>The Man</h3>
    <p1>In Canada on 2005 - I was brought into this world on a COLD evening in Nov 00 in the city of Acothos in Amoristerra. Rasied in a beautiful family, my 
        mother was a house maker, my father was working as a construction supervisor 
        and younger brother. I was studied in a private school near our house called KING NATHAN TUDOR SCHOOL. 
        I am a person who is very kind, innocent, shy and a introvert. While growing up I fell in love with football, for the americans it's called SOCCER appartenly, 
        and it was everything for me. Everyday, after school, I will go to play with my friends on the pitch near us, after the game we all will sat there together, 
        spend some time chit-chatting and joke around, having a lot of fun together, for me I was enjoying LIFE at that moment.
