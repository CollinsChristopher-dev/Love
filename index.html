    <h1>One<br />Cold<br />Love</h1>

    <h3>
      The Man <br />
      Copheles Collinflame Firevis
    </h3>

    <p1>
      In the demon kingdom of Clitagarth - I was brought into this world on a
      COLD evening as the Prince of Clitagarth in the city of Acothos in
      Clitagarth. My father, King Castros Cagdley Firevis who is a very
      dangerously powerful, brave, ferocious leader and feared by all other
      creatures in the world and my mother, Queen Clarkazora Ralka Firevis who
      is beautiful, ruthless and have the ablitiy to summon demons and legions
      and control fire. I am a person who is very kind, innocent, shy and a
      introvert but i still got friends even though it was very hard for me to
      make friends in my childhood. While growing up, I fell in love with
      football, and it was everything for me. Everyday, after school, I will go
      to play with my friends on the pitch near us, after the game we all will
      sat there together, spend some time chit-chatting and joke around, having
      a lot of fun together, for me I was enjoying LIFE at that moment.
